# IDS2023_StoreSales
Introduction to Data Science project  
Authors: Kristjan Radsin, Joonas Tiitson, Juhan Pauklin  

Link to the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data  

Being able to predict sale numbers allows vendors to optimise inventory management and improve overall operational efficiency.  
In our project we worked on a dataset from Kaggle that contains information regarding sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador.  
  
The objective of this project was to to use different machine learning techniques to forecast the number of sales of a product based on the specifications of its status  
and to identify how seasonality, promotions and oil prices influence the sale of products.

## Code  
Project_StoreSales.ipynb should be run first to create a merged dataset merged_train.csv
Then KNN training.ipynb, Random_forest_training.ipynb and Arima training.ipynb can be run to train the models  
Lastly PlotsforPresentation.ipynb is used to create plots from which data can be examined visually.
